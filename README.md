# ECE-2035
Programming for Hardware/Software Systems
## Course Description
This course presents execution and storage mechanisms used to support high level programming languages and operating systems. This design-oriented course describes how complex mechanisms are created using operations and storage defined in an instruction set architecture. Assembly language examples illustrate key course concepts. Lecture material is reinforced by design projects that require C programming and MIPS assembly language programming, focusing on performance and storage resource requirements on hardware platforms.
## Course Objectives
* Understand how execution and storage constructs in high-level programming languages and operating systems are implemented on a hardware platform.
* Learn design principles for sequential, procedural programming, the C programming language and MIPS assembly language, and the use of common tools for software development and performance evaluation.
* Build experience in systems-oriented design, focusing on performance and storage requirements of the target application and hardware platform.
